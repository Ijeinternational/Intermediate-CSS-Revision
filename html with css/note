to style your code using external css, create a new file, name it in relation to css, input your style 
or changes you want to effect. on the main coding page, use the tag <link rel="stylesheet" href="put in the name
of the external css file here"> and save
of the three types of css, the most efective is the inline css, followed by the internal before the external.
the external css is the best to use to effect change on several pages of code. while the inline or internal
is good effecting singular changes or commands
selectors in coding include tags e.g img{}, class, e.g .baton, and ids e.g #brocolli. the major difference
class selectors and id selectors is in that, in class selector, you can use more than one class in an inline css
but for ids, you can't use more than one on an inline css
e.g of two class in an inline class
<img class="brocolli" src="" alt="">
